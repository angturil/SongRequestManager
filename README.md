# Mod Info
Song Request Manager is an integrated, fully Customizable song request bot and Console for BeatSaber. It started life as an extensive rewrite of the built in song request bot in https://github.com/brian91292/BeatSaber-EnhancedTwitchChat, but quickly grew in scope and features. Its now a separate but dependent module. This mod and its companions, EnhancedStreamChat and StreamCore, are direct upgrades from the original EnhancedTwitchChat release, by the original authors. 

This mod has been in use for many months, and is constantly updated. While this is a first official release as a standalone mod, its been in continuous use for months now, and is extensively tested. The bot is compatible with release 0.13.1. 

# Current State

The current bot is compatible with Release 1.0.0. Use the latest installer.

# TTS Notes
If you're using TTS, you'll want to reduce the amount of spam the bot produces. You can do this a number of ways. Filtering out your Name from TTS, or 
```
in RequestBotSettings.ini
BotPrefix="! "
```
then filter out the ! lines on your tts client.

A song request icon will appear on the upper right of the main menu. It will be green if there are song requests in the queue, but you can press it regardless.
